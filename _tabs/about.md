After graduating from Michigan State with an M.S. in applied math in 2011, I
stayed to teach large lectures and to help develop and maintain their online
math homework system. One year later I moved to Ohio and taught at The Ohio
State University for a semester.  After that I transitioned into full-time
software development.  As of Fall 2021 I'm in the Mathematics Ph.D. program
at University of Nevada, Reno.

I live in Ohio with my wife and our abundance of cats, and I travel to Reno
as needed for this program. At this stage that's about once per year. Since
2017 I've been occasionally teaching math and computer science courses
locally and online, although that is on hold for now so that I can focus on
this program.


# Research Interests
- Numerical methods for ODEs and PDEs
